Before building a you will need to set the property in the pom.xml that points to your javafx home.

Once this is done it should be compilable with standard maven commands:

  mvn clean package

(Maven 3 or greater is required)


once packaged it can be executed with:

  java -Djavafx.runtime.path=<location> -jar ./target/scala-fx-bytecode-viewer-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
 
where javafx.runtime.path is set to the location of the java fx runtime, for instance:

  ./javafx-sdk2.1.0-beta/rt/
